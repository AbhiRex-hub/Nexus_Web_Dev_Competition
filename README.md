# Nexus_Web_Dev_Competition
Created for BIT Sindri IETE Nexus competition (Theme - Books website)


Hello all!!
I have created this website called Justbooks.com for BIT Sindri IETE Nexus competition. Below I have given the description about working of the website.

'''''''JUSTBOOKS.com is a website where people can buy books, with option of ordering hardcopy as well as buying E-books.
Also, people can rent the books which can save considerable money. The website also releases interviews conducted with many famous authors. 
The website also hosts many different competitions like book writing, poem writing, article writing, etc. 
Users will be able to find the desired content easily as the website provides recommendation based on the likings of users. 
The Home page lists all the available options available to navigate to the specific pages like bestsellers, trending content, personal recommendations, etc.
so that user can navigate through the website easily.'''''''


Some part of the homepage is shown below. As shown in the image there is a navigation bar at the top by using which you can navigate through the website easily.
